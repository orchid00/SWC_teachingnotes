Data Carpentry (DC) website: http://www.datacarpentry.org/


History
SWC - Founded in by 1998 by Brent Gorda and Greg Wilson
DC - Founded in 2013 by Tracy Teal 

Shared goals and approach:
- Goal: fill gaps in computational training for researchers 
- Goal: increase condience/motivation of learners to enable future learning
- Approach: Volunteers teach 12-hr workshops around the globe

SWC vs. DC
- better programming skills vs. better data management/analysis/visualization skills
- domain/subject agnostic vs. domain/subject specific
- modular curriculum vs dataset- and language-driven curriculum
- version control required vs version control not required
