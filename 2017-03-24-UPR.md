Terms: A vocabulary lesson

Educational psychology is the study of how people learn

Instructional design is the engineering of lesson

Pedagogical content knowledge (PCK)

##Teaching as a Performance Art

How do teachers improve?

*Exercise Option 1*      
Exercise: Feedback that helps you improve
List three things you have done this month that someone corrected or helped you improve?
  


Teacher- teacher feedback

Jugyokenkyu aka Lesson Study

*Exercise ~6 min*    
Excercise: Evaluate a peer teaching python
- Watch first 3 min 30 seconds https://vimeo.com/139316669
- Add you comments below about good and bad things the instructor does/says

Sometime we only remember the bad feedback:  https://github.com/swcarpentry/instructor-training/blob/gh-pages/fig/deathbulge-jerk.jpg

Strive to give feedback that is actionable rather than hurtful: http://www.lunarbaboon.com/comics/feedback.html

When requesting feedback from peers:
- Ask for feedback on specific aspects of the content or delivery
- Ask for a compliment sandwhich of postive and negative things
- Use a translator to help you interpret the meaning and significance

*Exercise*                    
Exercise: Video Feedback on your public speaking introduction  
- Split into groups of two or three. One person will use a phone to record the other speak, trading turns.
- The first person introduce herself (in no more than 90 seconds) while being recording.
- Repeat for all people in the group. 
- After everyone in the group has finished talking, watch the videos as a group. 
- Everyone gives verbal "compliment sandwich" feedback on all three videos 
- Summarize the feedback on your video in the etherpad next to your name.

Great teachers are made not born

## Motivation and Demotivation

Strategies for Motivating Learners

1. Teach things that are easily mastered and immediatly useful. 

2. Give "immediate payoff" so students are continually mastering new things

3. Inspire the students to keep using and learning these tools after the workshop

Look at this figure http://swcarpentry.github.io/instructor-training/fig/what-to-teach.png

*Exercise ~18 min*   
Exercise: Useful and easy to learn

- Think about something you did this week (e.g. wrote a function, bulk downloaded data, did some stats in R, forked a repo), and determine how useful this thing is and how hard it was to learn

- Pair up with your neighbor and decide where this thing fits on  2x2 grid of “short/longtime to master” and “low/high usefulness”? 

- In the class Etherpad, share the task and where it fits on the 2x2 grid. 

Think - 5 minutes 
Pair - 5 minutes 
Share - 8 minutes 

*Exercise*                  
Exercise: share a examine of a class where you were very motivated to learn and why

Motivational Themes
- eye opening experience
- right level of a challenge
- Instructor accessibility (seating arrangement, one-on-one talking)
- real-world applicability
- hands-on activities that engage learners and have built-in formative assessment

How do we make sure that we don't (accidentally) demotivate our learners?

Common pitfalls that instructors fall into
- Negatively commenting on learner tools 
- Going down a nitty-gritty rabbit hole with advanced learners
- Pretending you know more than you really know
- Using trivalizing language 

*Exercise*                  
Exercise: Share an example of when you were demotived AND how the professor could have handled this differently

Demotivational Themes
- being rude
- being boring
- doesn't convey the utility
- dismissive comments
- saying a student is wrong without addressing that its a common misconception

Dealing with Impostor syndrome

Accessibility
- Our opperations guide has a checklist to make sure that our workshops are accessibily to all learners that may need special accomdations: http://www.datacarpentry.org/accessibility/
- Reach out and ask the learners if they have special needs.

*Exercise*                     
Exercise: Video record concept map
- Break out into your groups and your concept map. 
- This time, have one person record while the other speaks. 
- Give feedback in terms of Positive Content, Positive Delivery, Negative Content, Negative Delivery.
- Type the feedback in the Etherpad below. 
- Also type How was the experience different now that you have a concept map?

Positive Content   
Positive Delivery   
Negative Content   
Negative Delivery   
How was the experience different?   

## Homework 
1. Read the [operations guide](https://software-carpentry.org/workshops/operations/)
2. Install the base software carpentry software. Directions for installs on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux can be found [here](http://swcarpentry.github.io/workshop-template/)

################################# LiveCoding ##################################

## Live Coding

Objectives: Understand why we teach programming using live coding.
Objectives: Give a short demonstration of live coding

The UNIX shell for loop lesson: http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/05-loop/
The objective of this lesson is for students to learn to write a loop that applies one or more commands separately to each file in a set of files.

Note: This lesson serves as both a script for the instructor and a tutorial for the learner. 

Quote: "Teaching is theatre not cinema." - Neal Davis

*Exercise ~15 min*    
Exercise: Evaluate your peer's live coding effectiveness
1. Watch this video of poor live coding: https://youtu.be/bXxBeNkKmJE
2. Watch this video of good live coding: https://youtu.be/SkPmwe_WjeY
3. Populate a list of "do's and don'ts" for live coding that you would like to emulate or avoid in your own live coding practice.
Don'ts

*Exercise*                    
Exercise: Live coding in groups of three
1. One person teach 3 minutes of a chosen lesson episode using live coding. Another group members sets a timer for 3 minutes.  
2. Repeat step 1 for all group members.
3. Give feed back to your group members feedback using a 2x2 method for content/delivery postive/negative.
4. Summarize the feedback you received in the etherpad. 

Positive Content -
Positive Delivery - 
Negative Content -
Negative Delivery -

################################ Lessons Objectives ##################################	

## Lessons and Objectives

How can I design more effective lessons?
What lessons do Software and Data Carpentry currently contain?

Learning Objectives

Each learning objective should have a measurable or verifiable verb specifying what the learner will do, and should specify the criteria for acceptable performance. 

Learner-centered with backwards lesson design
- concrete outcomes (learning obejectives)
- practice with feedback (formative assessment) until desired outcome is achieved

Some better verbs for different levels of learning
http://swcarpentry.github.io/instructor-training/19-lessons/

Knowledge - name, define
Comprehend - restate, explain
Application - apply, use
Analyze - differentiate, compare
Synthesis - design, construct
Evaluate - rate choose

This is a bad learning object: Understand the rules of right of way when driving

*Exercise*     
Exercise: Better learning objectives  
Improve this learning objective: Understand the rules of right of way when driving
