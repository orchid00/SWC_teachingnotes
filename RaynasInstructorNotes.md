################################# Overview ##################################	

This is the script I use when teaching workshop. I view it on my computer as a text file, rather than the Github rendered version, so I recommend viewing with a text editor. 

- Each 3 hour block of a workshop is marked with long strings of `######`
- All lines marked with `##` are large headers that pasted in the etherpad before the session begins 
- All other lines of text are pasted into the etherpad in real time (maybe with some bolding, maybe not), right before I say them outloud. These lines of text serve as my main talking points. All the words I use come from the main lesson materials, which I keep in view on my screen.
- All prompts to myself that I do not pasted in the etherpad are *recorded in italics*

For my setup, I have open my notes file, the etherpad, the current episode webpage, any webpages I want to present, and (for online workshops) blue jeans.

For most exercises, I past all the students names in the blank space below the question prompt and clear the color coding. This gives a student a place to put their answer and gives me the ability to see who has and has not completed the exercise yet.

################################# Assessment ##################################	

## Novices and Formative Assessment

Novices, Competent Practitioners, and Experts
- Novice: a learner who doesn't know what they don't know (e.g. doesn't know they color coding in Excell can be read into R or python)
- Competent practitioner: a learner who knows a good amount and is also aware of what they don't know (e.g. car owners have a basic understand of how the car works under hood)
- Expert: a learner who understand concepts in complete details

Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry assume that all learners in our workshops are novices. We help them build a structure on which they can build and then learn more details. 

*Exercise*                    
Exercise: Your mental models
What is your primary research domain or speciality/expertise?  What is one mental model you use to frame and understand your work?  

*Exercise*                    
Exercise: Manuals vs. Tutorials  
What’s the difference between a manual and a tutorial? (Think in terms of the differences between novices and competent practitioners.) Can one document do a good job of being both?

Two types of assessment:
- Summative assessment (e.g. the final exam, the driving examine to get your driver's license)
- Formative assessment (e.g. real-time feedback about performace of playing the piano). Must be very fast and rapid. Quick to administer and quick to evaluate

Multiple Choice Question (MCQ) - For good MCQs, the goal is not to trick the learner but to asses miscconception

MCQ: what is 27 + 15 ?
a) 42: the answer to life, the universe, and everything?
b) 32
c) 312
d) 33

*Exercise*           
Exercise: Identify the misconception
Describe is the misconception associated with each wrong answer (distractor)?

*Exercise*                       
Exercise: Handling Outcomes   
What should the instructor do when, the class votes for: 
1. mostly the wrong answers?  
2. mostly the right answer?  
3. an even spread between options?

Watch this one minute YouTube video with peer-peer instruction: https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=1&v=2LbuoxAy56o

*Exercise ~15 min?*   
Exercise: Modeling Novice Mental Models
Create a multiple choice question related to a topic you intend to teach and explain the diagnostic power of each its distractors (i.e., what misconception is each distractor meant to identify?)

Teacher- teacher feedback

Jugyokenkyu aka Lesson Study

I, We, You vs. You, Y'all, We

*Exercise ~6 min*    
Excercise: Evaluate a peer teaching python
- Watch first 3 min 30 seconds https://vimeo.com/139316669
- Add you comments below about good and bad things the instructor does/says

Sometime we only remember the bad feedback:  https://github.com/swcarpentry/instructor-training/blob/gh-pages/fig/deathbulge-jerk.jpg

Strive to give feedback that is actionable rather than hurtful: http://www.lunarbaboon.com/comics/feedback.html

When requesting feedback from peers:
- Ask for feedback on specific aspects of the content or delivery
- Ask for a compliment sandwhich of postive and negative things
- Use a translator to help you interpret the meaning and significance

*Exercise*                    
Exercise: Video Feedback on your public speaking introduction  
- Split into groups of two or three. One person will use a phone to record the other speak, trading turns.
- The first person introduce themselves in no more than 90 seconds while being recording.
- Repeat for all peopl in the group. 
- After everyone in the group has finished talking, watch the videos as a group. 
- Everyone gives verbal "compliment sandwich" feedback on all three videos 
- Paste the feeback you received in the etherpad next to your name. Include self feedback and feedback from the group

## Expertise and Memory

How can we describe the difference in learning between a novice and expert?
How is memory a limiting factor in learning?
How expertise can be helpful and harmful?

Connectivity

Novices and experts organize information differently: https://github.com/swcarpentry/instructor-training/issues/98

Concept maps

Concept map examples
- Choosing a good chart - http://swcarpentry.github.io/instructor-training/fig/05/choosing-a-good-chart-09.pdf
- ggplot2 cheatsheet - the expert can write a command to draw a beautiful plot, but the novice will need to refer to these concept maps for help building the command 
- UNIX - http://swcarpentry.github.io/instructor-training/fig/05/create-destroy.png

- A Concept Map of Concept Maps: http://cmap.ihmc.us/docs/images/Theory/Fig1CmapAboutCmaps-large.png

*Exercise ~20 mintues, give 5 min prompts for each step*   
Excersie: Concept maps
- Create a hand drawn concept map for something you would teach in five minutes. 
- Get in groups of two and present your concept maps to each other.
- Give feedback? Do they present concepts or surface detail? Which of the relationships in your partner’s map do you consider concepts and vice versa?
- In the etherpad, write how you think concepts maps might be useful in your teaching?

Concepts maps can be used in many ways in lesson design and execution:
- To aid lesson design
- To aid communication with co-teachers
- To aid communication with learners
- To formatively assess learners
 

Memory

Seven plus or minus two

The average person can hold 7 things (plus or minus two) in short term memory at a time.

*Exercise ~5 min*   
Exercise: The Serial Position Effect 
- Visit this website: http://cat.xula.edu/thinker/memory/working/serial
- Press start and try to memorize the words that pass across screen
- How many words can you recall? Where were they in the sequence
- Type the number of words and rough location in the sequence in the ethpad

################################# Cognitive Load ##################################	

## Cognitive Load

Inquiry-based Learning

Two things students must simultaneously learn 
- learning the concepts
- learning how to solve problems

Cognitive load
- Intrinsic load: what learners have to keep in mind in order to carry out a learning task
- Germane load: the (mental effort required to create linkages between new information and old (which is one of the things that distinguishes learning from memorization)
- Extraneous load: everything else that distracts or gets in the way

Step-by-stp solutions followed by faded examples

Example: Building a complex UNIX for loops https://github.com/ngs-docs/2016-adv-begin-shell-genomics#renaming-a-bunch-of-files

After seeing this, should a learner be expected to write a for loop from scratch?

Faded example: I, We, You
This has all the steps for teaching a function in python. 12 is the output for the given input
# total_length(["red", "green", "blue"]) => 12
def total_length(words):
    total = 0
    for word in words:
        total += len(word)
    return total

Now with two missing pieces and a sligthly different function
# word_lengths(["red", "green", "blue"]) => [3, 5, 4]
def word_lengths(words):
    lengths = ____
    for word in words:
        lengths ____
    return lengths

Now with four missing pieces and a sligthly different function
# concatenate_all(["red", "green", "blue"]) => "redgreenblue"
def concatenate_all(words):
    result = ____
    for ____ in ____:
        ____
    return result

Now it must be written  from scratch
# acronymize(["red", "green", "blue"]) => "RGB"
def acronymize(words):
    ____


*Exercise*                    
Exercise: Faded example
- Pick a block of code from an existing Software or Data Carpentry lesson, or from another lesson you have taught recently.
- Replace 2-3 pieces of the code with a blank.
- Write a question to test the student’s ability to correctly fill in that blank.
- Paste your faded example in the Etherpad 


Parsons Problem

Give students a pile of jumbled code and ask them to put it in order.

*Exercise ~5 min*   
Exercise: Parsons Problem
- Write 5 or 6 lines of code that does something useful,
- Jumble them,
- Write a question that asks learner to unjumble them to do a specific tasks

################################# Motivation Demotivation ################################	

## Motivation and Demotivation

Strategies for Motivating Learners
Teach things that are easily mastered and immediatly useful. 
Give "immediate payoff" so students are continually mastering new things
Inspire the students to keep using and learning these tools after the workshop

Look at this figure http://swcarpentry.github.io/instructor-training/fig/what-to-teach.png

*Exercise ~18 min*   
Exercise: Useful and easy to learn
- Think about something you did this week (e.g. wrote a function, bulk downloaded data, did some stats in R, forked a repo), and determine how useful this thing is and how hard it was to learn
- Pair up with your neighbor and decide where this thing fits on  2x2 grid of “short/longtime to master” and “low/high usefulness”? 
- In the class Etherpad, share the task and where it fits on the 2x2 grid. 

Think - 5 minutes 
Pair - 5 minutes 
Share - 8 minutes 

*Exercise*                  
Exercise: share a examine of a class where you were very motivated to learn and why

Motivational Themes
- Instructor accessibility (seating arrangement, one-on-one talking)
- real-world applicability
- hands-on activities that engage learners and have built-in formative assessment

How do we make sure that we don't (accidentally) demotivate our learners?

Common pitfalls that instructors fall into
- Negatively commenting on learner tools 
- Going down a nitty-gritty rabbit hole with advanced learners
- Pretending you know more than you really know
- Using trivalizing language 

*Exercise*                  
Exercise: Share an example of when you were demotived AND how the professor could have handled this differently

Demotivational Themes
- being rude
- being boring
- doesn't convey the utility
- dissmissive comments
- saying a student is wrong without addressing that its a common misconception

Dealing with Impostor syndrome

Accessibility
- Our opperations guide has a checklist to make sure that our workshops are accessibily to all learners that may need special accomdations: http://www.datacarpentry.org/accessibility/
- Reach out and ask the learners if they have special needs. 


################################# Lessons Objectives ##################################	

## Lessons and Objectives

How can I design more effective lessons?
What lessons do Software and Data Carpentry currently contain?

Learning Objectives

Each learning objective should have a measurable or verifiable verb specifying what the learner will do, and should specify the criteria for acceptable performance. 

Learner-centered with backwards lesson design
- concrete outcomes (learning obejectives)
- practice with feedback (formative assessment) until desired outcome is achieved

This is a bad learning object: Understand the rules of right of way when driving

*Exercise*     
Exercise: Better learning objectives  
Improve this learning objective: Understand the rules of right of way when driving

Software and Data Carpentry Lessons

Our lessons are continually being improved after instructors teach them. 

Data Carpentry:
Genomics (cloud computing, UNIX, dataviz): http://datacarpentry.org/lessons/#genomics-workshop
Ecology or other tabular data (most popular with broadest reach) http://datacarpentry.org/lessons/#ecology-workshop
Geospatial data: http://datacarpentry.org/lessons/#geospatial-data-workshop
In prep: Social science http://datacarpentry.org/lessons/#social-science-materials
In prep: Semester long http://datacarpentry.org/semester-biology/
In prep: Reproducible reasearch with R: http://www.datacarpentry.org/rr-intro/
In prep: Reproducible reasearch with Jupyter Notebooks: https://reproducible-science-curriculum.github.io/rr-jupyter-workshop/

Software Carpentry (see https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/ for links to all lessons)
UNIX
Git
R
Python
SQL
Matlab
Automation & Make

*Exercise*     
Exercise: Better learning objectives  
Improve or modify a learning objective from the lesson you live coded. Paste the existing and your revised learning objective in the etherpad.
